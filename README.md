# YouTube-Scripts
This is a collection of YouTube helper scripts.

## ytFetchPlaylist.py
This script fetches all video ids from a Playlist and saves them to a json file usable by the bot scripts in this
repository. Call it with `python ytFetchPlaylist.py PLAYLIST_ID`  
**Important:** You have to create a [OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and
store the .json as `client_secret.json` to use this script.

## planned :D
A very simple bot to post a youtube playlist to a slack channel (It is Wednesday my dudes!)
